# bHat_ColorGame
First attempt at the color game app

## Basic Features / Premise

The user is presented with an n x n grid of squares. All but one of the squares will be the same color, and the other square will be slightly different in color. The user needs to click on the square that is of a different color. As the user progresses, the "n" value increases, and the colors become closer and closer together.

### Power Ups

The user has options for temporary power ups which make the game easier. (More on that to come)

## To do List v1.0

    - Make the program use a proper GridView and Adapter
    - Implement a timer for the game (you run out of time you lose)
    - Implement a scoring mechanism
    - Implement the power ups feature
    - Implement a high score system

### To do List for v2.0

    - Make a more interesting scoring mechanism
    - Perhaps some custom graphics in there?
    - Implement a global high score system, not just local
